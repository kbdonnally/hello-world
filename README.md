# hello-world

<h1>Intro tutorial repository</h1> <p> this somehow wrote twice? somehow "# hello-world" in bold makes the initial title thingie with a heading and caption, then I can write whatever I want. Only difference = the auto title has a red left border and what I write has a green left border. </p> 
<ul style="list-style-type: square"> Other styles: 
<li>"hello-world" heading =/= any left border</li> 
<li><ul>headings all have light grey bottom border that doesn't meet up with the one on top: thinking of how to do that... 
    <li>possibility: can you have multiple borders in CSS3?</li>
    <li>Can you stop a border before it meets the edge?</li>
    <li>Can you have different borders around the content vs. padding (maybe using "content-box" vs "border-box" type thing)</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
 <li>cannot change what links look like (unless I'm completely forgetting how inline CSS works? Or just all CSS is locked?)</li>
 <li>Okay yeah all CSS is locked; I can't change what the list icons look like either</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's the difference between "update README.md" and "Add an optional extended description..." beyond literal? How freq are extended descriptions used? <br> ...sorry for this blatant abuse of headings styles... </h2>
